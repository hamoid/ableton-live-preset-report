# Ableton Live Preset Report

This is a Python debugging tool that searches for Ableton Live preset files (.adv) in the
specified folder, reads each preset file, parses the xml, and prints out some of
the values found in that xml file.

It may be useful for debugging collections of presets.

You need Python 3 to run it.
